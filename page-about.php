    <h2>The Improv Enthuthiast</h2>
    <p>To me, Improv isn’t a day-to-day job. Improv is something that I am incredibly passionate about - something that defines me for who I am. I’ve always enjoyed the “in-the-moment” brand of humour, and being a part of the world of improv comedy has been an exciting journey for me that’s landed me some interesting moments, like being a part of The Amazing Race Canada, or even being able to team up with former CTV host, Graham Neil. As the proud owner of Atomic Improv, I’m dedicated to bringing joy, laughter, and unforgettable moments to you and yours, as we make our evenings all about you!</p>
